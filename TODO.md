# AI Vector Logo Generator - Implementation TODO

## Core Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Structure
- [x] Create project TODO tracking
- [x] Create main page layout with logo generator interface
- [x] Set up core components structure
- [x] Create utility functions for AI integration and SVG handling

### Phase 2: Frontend Components
- [x] Build LogoGeneratorForm component with company input fields
- [x] Create StyleSelector for logo style and format options
- [x] Implement LogoPreview component for real-time logo display
- [x] Add ExportOptions component for download functionality

### Phase 3: Backend API Development
- [x] Create logo generation API endpoint (/api/generate-logo)
- [x] Implement AI integration with Replicate FLUX model
- [x] Create logo export API endpoint (/api/export-logo)
- [x] Add SVG optimization and format conversion utilities

### Phase 4: AI Integration
- [x] Configure custom endpoint integration (no API keys required)
- [x] Set up system prompt for vector logo generation
- [x] Implement error handling and response processing
- [x] Add timeout management for AI requests

### Phase 5: Image Processing & Build
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Build application with `pnpm run build --no-lint`

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [x] API testing with curl commands (logo generation endpoints)
- [x] Test logo generation with various company descriptions
- [x] Validate SVG output and export functionality
- [x] Test responsive design and user experience

### Phase 7: Final Deployment
- [x] Start production server with `pnpm start`
- [x] Final testing and preview URL generation
- [x] Documentation and usage examples
